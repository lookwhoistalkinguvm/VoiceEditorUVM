#For templates that have help strings defined as part of the template, the help string can be viewed
#by opening this file and clicking on the button associated with the template in the fast button
#area. Normally this would insert the template, but when inserting into this file the help string is
#inserted instead.
#
#Only the templates defined in templates\00_python_04_built_in_functions.template currently have
#helpstrings defined.
